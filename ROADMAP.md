# Roadmap

Modules we would like to see in future versions of the library.

- BETTER NAME
	- Sum
	- Marbles
	- PeBBles
	- Bamm-Bamm
	- Pog
	
```
SUM.BrushManager
BB.BrushManager
POG.BrushManager
```

## Modules

- Microphone input
- GUI (canvas?)
- Kinect (As input)
- Leap Motion
- Most Pixels Ever
- GPGPU
- Shaders

## Tools
It would be helpful if there were a way to quickly wrap and build any BBMod project/example (or any HTML + JavaScript Web Apps) w/ NW.js. Perhaps we could write and include a script that automatically creates builds for these small experiments. e.g:

```
./buildexample.sh --input path/to/source --platforms "osx64,linux64,win32"
```
