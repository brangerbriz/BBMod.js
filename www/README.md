# liBB Website

this directory contains the liBB website, which includes documentation, examples and other info. Because the docs and the builds are auto-generated they are not tracked ( see the [gitignore](https://github.com/brangerbriz/liBB.js/blob/master/.gitignore) ), instead you should run the build script `npm run build` see the [dev notes](https://github.com/brangerbriz/liBB.js) for more detail on the build script.
