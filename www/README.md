# liBB Website

this directory contains the liBB website, which includes documentation, examples and other info. Because the docs and the build ( the debug version used by the examples on the site ) are auto-generated they are not tracked ( see the [gitignore](https://github.com/brangerbriz/liBB.js/blob/master/.gitignore) ), instead the docs should be generated by running the docs script `npm run docs` and the debug build script `npm run build:debug`. Alternatively, you could run the build script `npm run build` which will build the docs, the debug version of the library in this directory as well as the compiled and minified libraries into the build folder.
