# liBB docs

This is where the auto-generated documentation goes. Because these files are auto-generated they are not tracked ( see the [gitignore](https://github.com/brangerbriz/liBB.js/blob/master/.gitignore) ), instead they should be generated by running the docs script `npm run docs` or `npm run build` ( which will build the library as well as the docs )
